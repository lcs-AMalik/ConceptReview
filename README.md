# Concept Review

This project contains example apps that take their primary input from a variety of sources.

## Input by User Action

### Noughts and Crosses

![image alt text](noughts-and-crosses.png)

*Noughts and Crosses*, also known as "x's and o's", generates data entirely from [user actions that trigger events](x-source-tag://user_action).

Sequence and selection statements are used to detect a [winning condition](x-source-tag://winning_condition) â€“ three of the same symbol in a row, column, or diagonal. If nine turns occur and neither player's moves triggers a winning condition, a draw is obtained.

Abstraction is used through the [`TileView` structure](x-source-tag://tile_view) â€“Â this helps to manage complexity as the same logic would otherwise be completely repeated nine times within `GameBoardView`. Instead, the logic for a tile is *defined* once and simply *called* nine times from [`GameBoardView`](x-source-tag://game_board). As a result, overall project code length is significantly reduced.

When a game is completed, the [result is added to a list](x-source-tag://adding_to_list) that tracks the history of games played. This list is then displayed to the user in the History section of the user interface.

* Callout(Bug Hunt):
  Develop your logical error detective skills. ðŸ”Ž 
  
  There are at least three problems with the logic of this app.
  
  Play some games, tap around, and try to do things that a user should not do. Break the game!
  
  Once you find the problems, fix them.
  
  Then [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/), identify the problems you found, and share your solutions, in your private portfolio space.

* Callout(Animation Action):
  Small animations add a lot of flair to an app. âœ¨ 
  
  When a tile is tapped and filled in with a player's symbol, make the tile rotate twice, quickly.
